0,1. How is the statistical significance of an insight assessed?,"Hypothesis testing is used to find out the statistical significance of the insight. To elaborate, the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis are stated, and the p-value is calculated.After calculating the p-value, the null hypothesis is assumed true, and the values are determined. To fine-tune the result, the alpha value, which denotes the significance, is tweaked. If the p-value turns out to be less than the alpha, then the null hypothesis is rejected. This ensures that the result obtained is statistically significant.",A1,A1

Unlike covariance, correlation tells us how strong the relationship is between two variables. The value of correlation between two variables ranges from -1 to +1.The -1 value represents a high negative correlation, i.e., if the value in one variable increases, then the value in the other variable will drastically decrease. Similarly, +1 means a positive correlation, and here, an increase in one variable will lead to an increase in the other.
