"1675270905-2","https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/statistics-interview-questions/","Hypothesis testing is used to find out the statistical significance of the insight. To elaborate, the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis are stated, and the p-value is calculated."
"1675270905-3","https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/statistics-interview-questions/","After calculating the p-value, the null hypothesis is assumed true, and the values are determined. To fine-tune the result, the alpha value, which denotes the significance, is tweaked. If the p-value turns out to be less than the alpha, then the null hypothesis is rejected. This ensures that the result obtained is statistically significant."
