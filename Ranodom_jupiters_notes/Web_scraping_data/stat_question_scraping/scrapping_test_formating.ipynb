      "1. Hash tables are the data structures that are used to denote the representation of key-value pairs in a structured way. The hashing function is used by a hash table to compute an index that contains all of the details regarding the keys that are mapped to their associated values. \n",

      "\n",
      "4. True, a normal curve will have the area under unity and the symmetry around zero in any distribution. Here, all of the measures of central tendencies are equal to zero due to the symmetric nature of the standard normal curve. \n",

Following steps can be used to determine the length of sharks:Define the confidence level (usually around 95%)Use sample sharks to measureCalculate the mean and standard deviation of the lengthsDetermine t-statistics valuesDetermine the confidence interval in which the mean length lies \n",
      "\n",
      "2. First, correlation does not imply causation here. Correlation is only used to measure the relationship, which is linear between rest and productive work. If both vary rapidly, then it means that there is a high amount of correlation between them. \n",

      "2. An inlier is a data point that lies at the same level as the rest of the dataset. Finding an inlier in the dataset is difficult when compared to an outlier as it requires external data to do so. Inliers, similar to outliers reduce model accuracy. Hence, even they are removed when they’re found in the data. This is done mainly to maintain model accuracy at all times. \n",
